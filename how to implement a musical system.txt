implement two classes conforming to the concepts:

accidental_count_num:
	a number type capable of representing the accidental of a note
	can also represent the quality of an interval (i.e. major, minor, etc)
	can be added with itself and can be negated.
note_letter_holder:
	a type that can store the letter (or symbol) used to represent a given note
	can calculate the diatonic distance between two notes
	can calculate an accidental_count_num that indicates teh quality of an interval between two notes
	can be shifted a diatonic distance

to be continued
